    "# Lab 6 - CART and Random Forest Predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this final part of the project, you will build and validate both CART and Random Forest models for predicting each target (Secchi Depth and Total Phosphorus) using the parcel features.\n",

    "### Data Splitting Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to extract 30% of the lakes to be used as a validation set, with the remaining lakes separated into a train/test split (again use 70%/30% split). In summary we should have a random split with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **30% of the lakes** marked as \"Validation\"\n",
    "- **50% of the lakes** (~70% of 70%) marked as \"Training\"\n",
    "- **20% of the lakes** (~30% of 70%) marked as \"Test\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Building and Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "For each target:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Perform a grid search for both CART and Random Forests using the training lakes\n",
    "2. Compare the best model of each type on the test lakes to determine the best overall model\n",
    "3. Refit the best model on the 70% of the lakes not in the validation set (training + test)\n",
    "4. Use the validation set to estimate the performance of this model\n",
    "5. Write up a summary of what we learn"
