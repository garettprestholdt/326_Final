    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will use both `polars` and `pyspark` to process the data from the MinneMUDAC 2016 competition Dive into Water Data.  While the MinneMUDAC 2016 site, is no longer live, a copy was obtained using the [Wayback Machine (https://web.archive.org) and has been provided in [the overview notebook](./MinneMUDAC_2016_Overview.ipynb).  You should document your work in a Jupyter notebook, which will be used to submit your solution.\n",

    "## Lab 1 Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will perform the following tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download and unzip the data.\n",
    "2. Investigating the columns in various property data files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 1 - Data download and unzip\n",
    "\n",
    "While the download links on the original site no longer work, you can access the data by clicking on [this link](https://mnscu-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/bn8210wy_minnstate_edu/EdUePet8JsdKv5aUt9gvjoMBxQhXrOx73WpQyVNwLVDfkA?e=rR8qrc)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Move the zip file unto your repository\n",
    "2. Unzip and move the files into your data folder.\n",

    "**Hint.** Take a look the the Colab section of any module 5 lecture for an example."

    "1. Use `glob` to get a list of all the parcel files.\n",
    "2. Use a list comprehension contains pairs of value of the form `(year, df)` where `df` a `polars` or `pyspark` data frame for each file. Keep in mind that the files are large so we will need to leverage the lazy natures of `polars` and `pyspark`. You will want to use `scan_csv` in `polars`.  On the other hand, `pyspark` is lazy and will do minimal work on this step.\n",
    "3. Perform a column exploration by creating an indicator summary table, with on row per column and one column per year/file.  The values in the table should be `1` if the column is present in that year's file and `0` otherwise.  You may need to pivot or reshape your data frame to get it into this format.\n",
    "4. There is one problematic year.  Which year is it and what is the problem?  We will be skipping this year in future analysis.\n",
    "5. Sort the summary table by the column names and inspect the results.  In particular, look for similar names with different spellings or capitalizations.\n",
    "6. Identify the common columns that are present in all years."
