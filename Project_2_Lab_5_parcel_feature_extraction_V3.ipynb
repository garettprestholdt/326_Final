    "**Overview.** Remember that our target output file will have one row per year-lake combination.  To attach property information, we will need to group and aggregate the parcel data to create features for each lake-year combination.  When grouping the data, be sure to maintain the variables needed to join to the water quality data, namely the lake ID and year.  Since we are looking at tracking property development/change over time, we will want to generate features tracking\n",

    "Before we can construct features, we need to make sure we understand the parcel data.  The metro parcel data is provided by the State of Minnesota and the meta data can be found online.
