# 326_Final
This is my repositroy for my final project in my DSCI 326 class. The goal of this project was to see how water quality affected property pricing. The dataset was quite large (~10GB) so the main use for this project was to get used to performing lazy actions to format our data so that we could push it through a CART and Random Forest model. 

Each lab notebook tackled a different part of the process of getting to that point. Lab 1 was just downloading and looking at the raw data. Lab 2 was understanding how we would go about joining the tables together. Lab 3 created partitioned parquet files for easier lazy querying. Lab 4 was looking at the water quality table specifically and prepping it for join. Lab 5 we looked into which features could be used as predictors in our models. Lab 6 was fitting and validating our CART and Random Forest models.
